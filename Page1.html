      <h2 class="header2">Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        My childhood is what some would refer to as tumultuous. I spent a majority of my childhood and well into my early adult years were spent
        bouncing around from city to city and state to state within the U.S. never staying in one place for longer than a year or so.
        The list of states and cities that I've lived in goes on for ages, but, some of the more noteworthy places include Auburn, AL,
        where I graduated High School; Key West, FL, the first place that ever felt like home; and now, Denver, Colorado, where I've officially
        lived the longest. This constant moving built a certain resiliance to adapting and overcoming challenges within my life but, also came
        with a set of challenges in and of itself that I've only started recognizing as an adult.
      </p>

      <h2 class="header2">Youth</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of my youthful years (roughly 13-21) were spent moving just as much. Though, during this time is when I really started to discover
        what it is that I enjoy doing in life. I had recently moved to NJ and had no friends, as a way to keep myself entertained I delved
        into the world of tech and started learning anything and everything that I could about it, specifically in the realm of Apple, VR,
        and building computers. After about a year of doing this I came to the realization that I was spending way to much time consuming media
        and felt like I was wasting my life. I was 13, watching nothing but tech, SkyDoesMinecraft and Yogscast videos and these videos brought
        me nothing but joy and I knew that I wanted to try and make videos that could do that for someone else. So, I asked my dad if I could
        buy a ScreenRecorder and Minecraft from the appstore and just like that I'd entered into a new era in my life. I spent years creating
        YouTube videos, it was something I was genuinely good at and incredibly passionate about, eventually YouTube turned into Livestreaming
        on Twitch and that's where things really started to take off for me. It was a whole new world. I mean.. I really got to interact with the
        people that my content was impacting and eventually I started making money from this. Words cannot express the amount gratification that
        I felt. Anyway, around the time that I turned 21 my work-life balance between my day job and streaming started to take a toll on my relationship.
        Things had gotten exteremly bad between my then girlfriend and myself so, I decided to drop my twitch career to try and fix my relationship.
        Unfortunately things didn't work out and I ended up losing both my girlfriend and my audiance base.
      </p>

      <h2 class="header2">Now</h2>
      <p>
        Shortly after my girlfriend and I had split I moved out to Denver. It hands down is one of the best decisions I have ever made. Since
        moving out here I have met so many good people, this is one of the first times in my life where I've actually had a couple of friend
        groups had amazing job opportunities, started learning a new language and overall been able to truely enjoy life. I've been able to
         puruse music more vigorusly, I'm now pursing a career in tech and in a new relationship with an absoutely wonderful woman.
